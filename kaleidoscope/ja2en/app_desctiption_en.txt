We've developed a kaleidoscope using the iPhone's camera.
 
This is a camera application which also allows you to take pictures.
A picture taken with this app shows mysterious patterns, just like a kaleidoscope.
 
Moreover, take a look at the image while moving your iPhone. You will see mysterious movements in the image.
You can save your favorite images to your Camera Roll by tapping anywhere on the screen.
 
* Notes
- When setting the image taken with this app as a wallpaper for your PC, select the display type "tile".
- An indicator will be displayed while saving the image. Don't close the app until the indicator disappears.
- Using the application on iPhone 3G results in a slightly slow performance. It causes unstable movement.
